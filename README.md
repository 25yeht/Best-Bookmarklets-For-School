## How to Install Bookmarklets
In order to install bookmarklets, first, go to the script you want to install, copy all of the code, then create a new bookmark by right clicking on your bookmarks bar and then clicking "Add Page". Then, rename the **Name** to an inconspicuous name and then paste the code into the **URL** field.
### What if I don't have a bookmarks bar?
If you don't see your bookmarks bar, press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+B to get it.
